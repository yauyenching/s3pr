Executable file that can recategorize Sims 3 Pattern Custom Content (CC) and extract icons for better CC organization purposes. On 2nd October 2022, this tool was released for public use within the Sims 3 Tumblr community. See the community response [here](https://oxytosim.tumblr.com/post/696994286274805760/sims-3-pattern-recategorizer-s3pr-tool-organize).

## üí° Motivation ##
This tool is really mostly for my own purposes. I wanted my pattern CC to adhere to more consistent categories. For example, one creator may categorize a floral pattern as *'Fabric'*, while another creator may categorize a different floral pattern as *'Theme'*. To have all floral patterns be the same category in-game, one would have to manually edit the files.

Recategorizing manually for tons of files was soul-sucking. So, I set out to automate the task. Sims 3 .package files are not readable by normal means, so this work would not have been possible without Peter L Jone's [s3pi](http://s3pi.sourceforge.net/) .NET library.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation ##
This project was coded using [pythonnet](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) to utilize .NET libraries in Python, [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) to create a GUI with a modern interface, and [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) to create the executable file.

## üß∞ Dependencies ##
Microsoft's [.NET Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-my/download/details.aspx?id=17851) and the following python packages:
* pythonnet
* beautifulsoup4
* lxml
* customtkinter

The versions used can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/yauyenching/sims-3-pattern-recategorizer/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building this Project ##
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your system if you have yet to do so.  Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

Then, in the cloned repo, run `python ProgramGUI.py`.

## üôåüèª Acknowledgements ##
This tool was something I built primarily for my own incredibly niche uses. I found lots of satisfaction in being able to build a standalone desktop application. This project would not have been possible without our forefathers in Sims 3 tool modding: 

* [Anja Knackstedt's Pattern Preset Color Extractor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pattern-preset-color-extractor/) for building a fabulous tool whose code I heavily referenced for reading .package files and extracting the correct resources for patterns
* [Delphy's Sims 3 Pack Multi-Extracter](https://modthesims.info/d/364038/delphy-s-sims-3-pack-multi-extracter-updated-5th-sept-2009.html) for their useful tool that I referenced when building the UI
* [Peter L Jone's s3pi](http://s3pi.sourceforge.net/) for creating an indispensable library to work with Sims 3 files

Finally, I want to thank the following creators of the assets I used:
