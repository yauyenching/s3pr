WHAT IS THIS TOOL?
------------------
Sims 3 Pattern Recategorizer is a tool that lets you:
(1) extract icons, and/or 
(2) change the in-game category 
of Sims 3 pattern .package files.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
[Microsoft .NET Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)


HOW TO USE IT?
--------------
1) Put all the patterns you want to edit into one folder.
   ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION: Using this tool will **OVERWRITE** your existing files. 
   It is recommended you save a backup of your patterns before using this tool!
   

2) Select the settings you want. From left to right, they are:

   - Category [dropdown menu]: 
     Choose the new in-game category you want your pattern to belong to.
     (Only valid when *Change category* is CHECKED.)

   - Change category [checkbox]:
     When CHECKED, the program will recategorize the pattern files according to the chosen category.
   
   - Extract icon [checkbox]: 
     When CHECKED, the program will extract the icons from the .package files.
     NOTE: this program has a nice side effect of extracting ICON resources from ALL types of 
     .packages, not just patterns!

     - Overwrite icon with same filename [checkbox]:
       The program saves the extracted icon with the same filename as the .package files
       for easy organization. 
       When CHECKED, the program will overwrite any .png files with the same filename, even those
       generated by itself.
       When UNCHECKED, if an existing .png file with the same filename is found, the program will 
       automatically save files with a number index at the end (e.g., filename_2.png) so that the 
       program doesn't overwrite the existing file. This is also useful in the case of merged 
       pattern files, as there would be many ICON resources in one .package.


3) Run the program.
   The tool works for both single and merged pattern .package files, and skips over any files it
   does not recognize as a .package file containing pattern resources. Be warned that when working 
   with merged .package files, it will recategorize *every single* pattern in the file!
   NOTE: This program will only modify .packages when PTRN (0xD4D9FBE5) resources are found!
